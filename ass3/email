To all:
Feedback from Will:
Some advice for improving scores this week:
- Make plots complete and meaningful. Explore various input choices by comparing them visually, all at once. Setting up the numerical solution but leaving all input choices up to user is not sufficient.
- Be sure to address the full problem, not just part of it.
- Check your comments. Are you indicating very clearly what is happening in each major section of your code? Have you discussed the overall purpose and behavior of the script, as a whole?

Also, next week homework 4, you will not have to do problem Chapter 3 #2, but we will instead tackle 3.5.  I will do the derivation needed in class.

Remember, pizza at 4pm in room 304 SB1.   Oh yes, and a Fourier Transform Primer!

With kind regards,
